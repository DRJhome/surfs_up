# Surfs Up

## Project Overview:
 This project uses the power of advanced data storage and retrieval for analysis of temperature trends in Hawaii for June and December. This information will be used to determine if running a surf shop is going to be sustainable year round. We will use two seperate queries to get the data we need for analysis.
 
## Results:
+ the average temperature from June and December is only 4 degrees.
+ The maximum temperature in December is only 2 degrees colder than June
+ The minimum temperature in December is only 8 degrees colder than June

## Summary:
looking at the temperatures we can say the Surf Shop would be sustainable. There is a lot of factors that should be looked at before fully going forward with the Surf Shop. There would need to be more queries run on the factors listed below. 
+ Rain totals
+ Is the size of waves different during the seasons
+ is there any times of the years that beaches are closed to surfing

Running these additional queries will help the owner really plan out the sustainablility of the shop.
